# ml-template

ML code templates for fast starting or easy conversion in/between these frameworks:

- tensorflow 1.12
- tensorflow 2.1
- pytorch 1.4

**Note**: The hierarchy here DOES NOT represent the real one.<br/>
They are typically put into the same directory.<br/>
Cause multiply frameworks are involved, files are organized according to their generality.

# TODO

1. add model saving & resuming
