# ml-template

ML code templates for quick project starting with, or easy conversion between, these frameworks:

- tensorflow 1.12
- tensorflow 2.1
- pytorch 1.4

**Note**: The hierarchy here **DOES NOT** represent the real one. I usually put these files in one directory.<br/>
Cause multiple frameworks are involved here, files are organized according to their generality.

# TODO

1. add model saving & resuming
